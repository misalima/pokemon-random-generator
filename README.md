This is a simple web application that generates a random Pokémon and displays information about it, such as its name, type, height, and weight. 
The user can click a button to generate a new random Pokémon.

The application uses an XMLHttpRequest to retrieve information about the Pokémon from an external API, and then displays the information on the page using JavaScript. The application also uses HTML and CSS to create the layout and styling of the page.

With this project I could practice: 
- Using flexbox to position elements;
- Making HTTP requests to external APIs using the XMLHttpRequest object;
- Handling events using event listeners and callback functions, including the click and readystatechange events;
- Updating the content of an HTML page dynamically using JavaScript.

I am a Pokémon fan, so it was a great and fun project to build. I intend to come back to it in the future, and make it more interesting with more features.
